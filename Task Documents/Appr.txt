1. Can you share an example of a time when you utilized information from a learning activity to solve a problem at work? How did it impact your performance? 

Learning Activity:
I successfully implemented Harbor, a private image registry, integrated with Trivy as a vulnerability scanner. I acquired this knowledge through a detailed tutorial on YouTube, which covered setting up Harbor for secure image storage and integrating Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

Problem:
Our organization needed a robust solution for managing Docker images securely. We were facing challenges with ensuring the security of images stored in our Docker registry, particularly in terms of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities proactively.

Solution:
Drawing from the YouTube tutorial, I proposed and implemented the setup of Harbor with Trivy integration. The implementation included:

    Setting Up Harbor: I configured Harbor as a private image registry, providing a centralized repository for Docker images. This ensured that all images were stored securely within our infrastructure.

    Integrating Trivy: Following best practices from the tutorial, I integrated Trivy as a vulnerability scanner with Harbor. Trivy scans Docker images for known vulnerabilities in their dependencies and provides detailed vulnerability reports.

    Automating Scans: I automated the scanning process using scheduled tasks within Harbor and Trivy, ensuring that newly uploaded images underwent automatic vulnerability assessments before deployment.

Impact on Performance:
